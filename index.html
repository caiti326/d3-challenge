          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Heathcare Access and Poverty, Amongst Other Demographic Indicators</h2>
          <p>Using a 2014 U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System dataset, we are able to explor
            a set of demogrpahic elements (poverty percentage, age, and income) in each state in the United States against factors
            like access to healthcare, percentage of state's population who smoke, and obesity rates. While not all comparisons
            produced compelling correlations, they were some that proved very insightful.
          </p>

          <p>First was a look at the correlation between access to healthcare and the percentage of people experiencing poverty in a state.
            While there were some states that were outliers, by and large, when there is a higher percentage of people who lack healthcare 
            in a state, that state also has a higher number of people experiencing poverty.
          </p>

          <p>Additionally, when looking at the correlation between obesity rates and income, we can see that states with lower median incomes 
            tend to have a higher obesity rates. This correlation is further supported when looking at the obesity percentage aginst the poverty 
            percentage in a given state. This could be a demonstration of the lack of healthy food availability at affordable pricesand the tendancy 
            to for lower income families to rely on fast food and processed foods. More data would be needed to draw a clearer line between these two.

            Finally, when looking at the percentage of smokers in a given state and how much of that state's population experiences poverty, we see that
            the states located in the south tend to be the highest in both areas. While those in the northeast and midwest tend to be on the lower side
            in both areas.
